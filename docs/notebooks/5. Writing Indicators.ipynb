    "This notebook explains how to create and integrate custom stock indicators in **PyBroker**.  Indicators in **PyBroker** are written using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), a powerful library for numerical computing. To optimize performance, we'll also be utilizing [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), a JIT compiler that translates Python code into efficient machine code. Numba is especially helpful for accelerating code that involves loops and NumPy arrays. Here's how we import these libraries:"
