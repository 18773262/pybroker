You can also train other model types like gradient boosted machines, neural networks, or any other architecture you would like! And you can specify an [input_data_fn](https://www.pybroker.com/en/latest/reference/pybroker.model.html#pybroker.model.model) for your model in case you need to customize how its input data is built. For example, this would be needed when constructing input for autoregressive models (i.e. ARMA or RNN) since they use multiple past values to make predictions.\n",
