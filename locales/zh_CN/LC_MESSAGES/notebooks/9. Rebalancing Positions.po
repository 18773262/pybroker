"**PyBroker** can be used to simulate rebalancing a portfolio. This means "
"that **PyBroker** can simulate adjusting the asset allocation of a "
"portfolio to match a desired target allocation. Additionally, our "
"portfolio can be rebalanced using `portfolio optimization "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization>`__, as this "
"notebook will demonstrate."
